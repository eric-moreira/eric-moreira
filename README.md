  <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm passionate about systems programming and getting as close to the hardware as possible. I have solid experience in C, Assembly, Python, and Rust, and I enjoy working on everything from bootloaders to drivers and operating systems. I'm driven by a deep curiosity to understand how things work under the hood, peeling back layers of abstraction. I study thoroughly and enjoy challenging myself with low-level projects that demand full system control.</p>
  <p>
    I have worked over the years with System Administration and Infrastructure, as well as software development, including automations, customer workflow improvements, and, more recently, creating customized workflows for our customers by integrating our base system with their specific needs. For the past 4 years I have been working on the Storage and Media Industry, developing and supporting post-production and broadcast media houses.
